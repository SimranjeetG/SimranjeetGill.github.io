                Passionate about harnessing the power of data to drive strategic business decisions. Currently pursuing a master's in information technology system at Illinois Institute of Technology, I bring a blend of experience in data analysis, cost-benefit approaches, and process optimization from India. I excel at analyzing complicated data sets and turning them into useful insights, having led paperless order processes and customer promotion campaigns.

                With hands-on proficiency in tools like SQL, R, Python, Jupyter, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, I aim to bridge the gap between data and business strategies. My skills extend beyond the realm of data. This unique blend allows me to understand the data's narrative and present it compellingly to various stakeholders.
